{{< hint info >}}
*Notes on what could appear on this page*

This is the landing page. Contains the most important high level measurements that can answer basic questions such as: how large is the network? is it growing/shrinking? how reliable is it? how much is it being used? where is it being used? how well does it perform?

- Number of peers (with 24 hour delta)
- Size of network (e.g. cids?) (with 24 hour delta)
    - How can we do that? Better not show something if we don’t have a good way to measure it.
    - Run four nodes split into the identifier space
- Number of different agents
- Geographic overview of peers
- TODO…
