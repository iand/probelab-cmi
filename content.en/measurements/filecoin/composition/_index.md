# Filecoin Network Composition

{{< hint info >}}
*Notes on what could appear on this page*

An interior detail page that provides details on the numbers and types of peers in the network. The kinds of questions we want to answer with this section are: how has the network changed over time? how diverse is the software participating in the network? what old versions of software need to be supported still? where are participants located?

- Number of peers over time
- Distribution of software agents (by peer count, current and historic)
- Newly discovered agents
- Kubo versions in use
- Geolocation of providers and clients
- Network providers (datacenter/private infra)
