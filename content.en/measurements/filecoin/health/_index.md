*Notes on what could appear on this page*

This is an interior detail page. Contains measurements related to the health and function of the network. Designed to answer questions such as: what is the request latency? what is the discovery success rate? how reliably and quickly does data propagate?

- Retrieval latency (via different resolution paths, each component in detail, current+historic)
- Churn, average lifetime of a peer
- Fragmentation/connectivity of network
- Distribution of content
- TODOâ€¦
