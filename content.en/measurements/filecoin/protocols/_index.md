# Filecoin Protocols

{{< hint info >}}
An interior detail page that provides an overview of the protocols used in the network with areas for each major protocol. The kinds of questions we want to answer are: what protocols are in use? what versions are supported? how fast is a new protocol or version being adopted? which protocols are obsolete? how reliable is each protocol? is the protocol performing as expected in the wild?
