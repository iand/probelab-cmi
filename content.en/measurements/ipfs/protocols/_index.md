# IPFS Protocols

{{< hint info >}}
*Notes on what could appear on this page*

An interior detail page that provides an overview of the protocols used in the network with areas for each major protocol, for example for IPFS we can include Bitswap, IPNS, Kademlia. The kinds of questions we want to answer are: what protocols are in use? what versions are supported? how fast is a new protocol or version being adopted? which protocols are obsolete? how reliable is each protocol? is the protocol performing as expected in the wild?

## Bitswap

- Discovery success rate
- Discovery latency
- Transfer latency
- Data transfer efficiency

## Kademlia/DHT

- Discovery success rate
- Lookup latency (also by provider and client location+datacenter)
- Number of hops
- Provider record liveness
- Routing table health

## libp2p

- transports
- what security and what multiplexers are people using
- 

## IPNS

- Discovery success rate
- Latency
